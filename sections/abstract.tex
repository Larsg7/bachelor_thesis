\section*{Abstract}

This work describes the computation of meson correlation functions via distillation for Wilson twisted mass fermions and its implementation. Correlation functions for charmonium states are calculated on 11 gauge configuration on a $24^3 \times 48$ sized lattice using 1, 2, 5 and 10 eigenvectors of the lattice lagrangian.
