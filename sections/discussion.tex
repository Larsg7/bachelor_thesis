This work represents a first test of distillation by Marc Wagner's work group, therefore the number of eigenvectors and gauge configurations was kept small.\\
The results do show that calculating meson masses using distillation is feasable. Even using such a limited number of gauge configurations produced a value close to that in the literature. To improve accuracy a higher number of configuration should be used. Looking at the different number of eigenvectors a trend towards more precise calculations can be seen. While increasing the number of configurations increases simulation times linearly, a higher number of eigenvectors will increase times quadratically.\\
Testing the effect of a higher number of gauge configurations I could observe an improvement in accuracy when doubling the number of configurations similar to that of doubling the number of eigenvectors. In conclusion it seems advisable to increase the number of configurations at twice the "speed" (??) in regards to the number of eigenvectors.
