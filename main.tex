	\subsection{Conventions}
	Throughout this work natural units will be used, so that
	$$\hbar = c = a = 1$$
	where $a$ is the distance between two lattice points.\\
	
	In any instance where one index appears twice the \textbf{Einstein summation notation} was used, an implicit summation is assumed.\\
	
	When working with path integrals the euclidean formulation of QCD is used where the real time $x_0$ is replaced with the imaginary time $x_0 = -ix_4$. Therefore the Minkowsky tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ is replaced by $\delta_{\mu\nu}$:
	$$\delta_{\mu\nu} = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
	1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
	\end{pmatrix}
	$$\\

	\section{Distillation}
	% descibe distillation
	The term distillation describes a quark-field smearing algorithm to compute hadron correlation functions. It was first described in 2009 by Michael Peardon \cite{distillation_paper}. Distillation promisises efficient computations of all-to-all quark propagators.\\
	
	Smearing is used to apply a smoothing function to the field before applying the creation operators. Smearing should remove short-range modes while keeping as many symmetries as possible. Distillation makes use of a gauge-covariant quark smearing based on the lattice Laplacian which is defined as follows
	\begin{equation}
	    -\nabla^2_{xy} = 6\delta_{xy} - \sum^3_{j=1}(\tilde{U}_j(x,t)\delta_{x+j,y} + \tilde{U}^\dagger_j(x-y,t)\delta_{x-j,y})
	\end{equation}
	
	Starting form the lattice Laplacian one can define a simple smearing operator
	\begin{equation}
	    J_{\omega,n}(t) = (1+\frac{\omega\nabla^2(t)}{n})^n
	\end{equation}
	
	$\omega$ and $n$ are tunable parameters. For large $n$, $J$ defines the exponential of $\omega\nabla^2$ which suppresses higher eigenmodes of the lapplacian hence only a few of the lowest modes contribute to J. % WHY?
	\begin{equation}
        \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} J_{\omega,n}(t) = \exp(\omega\nabla^2)
	\end{equation}
